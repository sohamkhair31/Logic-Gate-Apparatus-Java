# ⚡ Logic Gates GUI Application

A **Java Swing** application that visually simulates basic logic gates. Users can toggle **power** and **inputs** to see the outputs of **AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, XNOR, and NOT** gates in real time. Each gate can be individually selected to highlight its logic flow. 🖥️✨

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ Simulates 7 basic logic gates:
  - AND
  - NAND
  - OR
  - NOR
  - XOR
  - XNOR
  - NOT
- 🔌 Toggle **Power ON/OFF**
- 🎛️ Toggle **Inputs A and B**
- 🎯 **Single gate selection** highlights the gate in black while others remain gray
- 💡 Output LEDs change color depending on gate output:
  - Green = ON
  - Red = OFF
